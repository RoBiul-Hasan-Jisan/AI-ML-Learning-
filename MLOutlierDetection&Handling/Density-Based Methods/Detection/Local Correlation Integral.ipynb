    "# Local Correlation Integral\n",
    "LOCI is a density-based outlier detection algorithm that goes beyond simple distance or density measures by providing a multi-granular approach to outlier detection. The key innovation is that it doesn't require a fixed neighborhood size - it evaluates points at all scales simultaneously.\n",

    "Most methods (like LOF): Use a fixed neighborhood size (k)\n",
