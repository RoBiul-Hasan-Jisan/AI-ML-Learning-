    "# RBF SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of RBF (Radial Basis Function) SVM as creating flexible, custom-shaped boundaries around your data. Unlike linear classifiers that only draw straight lines, RBF SVM can draw complex, curvy boundaries that adapt to your data's natural groupings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-World Analogy: Island Maps\n",
    "Imagine plotting islands on a map:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear SVM: Can only draw straight lines between islands\n",
    "\n",
    "RBF SVM: Can draw boundaries that perfectly trace each island's coastline\n",
    "\n",
    "Core Concept: What is RBF Kernel?\n",
    "1. The Kernel Trick in Simple Terms\n",
    "Instead of trying to draw complex boundaries in original space, RBF SVM transforms data into a higher-dimensional space where linear separation becomes possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "# Before Kernel Trick (cannot separate):\n",
    "Original Space: [x1, x2] → Cannot draw circle to separate points\n",
    "\n",
    "# After Kernel Trick (can separate):\n",
    "High-Dim Space: [x1, x2, x1², x2², x1x2] → Can draw hyperplane\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Advantages vs Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "Excellent for non-linear problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective in high dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory efficient (uses only support vectors)\n",
    "\n",
    "Versatile with different kernel choices\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically well-founded (max margin principle)\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "Sensitive to parameters (γ and C)\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires feature scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be slow with large datasets (O(n²) to O(n³))\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficult to interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "Doesn't provide probability estimates by default\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use RBF SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Use Cases:\n",
    "Small to medium-sized datasets (n < 10,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex, non-linear decision boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "When feature count > sample count\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary classification problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider Alternatives When:\n",
    "Very large datasets → Use Linear SVM or Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Need probabilities → Use Logistic Regression or Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability needed → Use Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-class problems → Consider Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "RBF SVM = Non-linear classifier using distance-based similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Must scale features before using\n",
    "\n",
    "γ controls boundary complexity, C controls regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Training is O(n³), prediction is O(n_sv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Works best with small-to-medium datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors define the decision boundary\n",
